# AI-Powered-Insurance-Claims-Triage-System (Phase 1)

This repository contains the Phase 1 implementation of an AI-driven system for triaging insurance claims. The goal is to automate the classification of claim severity (Low, Medium, High) using a transformer-based language model, while providing a clean and intuitive interface for users via Streamlit. The project focuses on speed, transparency, and scalability by combining a robust backend model with an interactive frontend dashboard.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Phase Includes

Phase 1 focused on establishing the core functionality of the triage system â€” from dataset preparation and model training to full-stack integration with the user interface. Key accomplishments include:

- Building a **RoBERTa-based transformer model** fine-tuned on synthetic claim narratives.
- Developing a **Streamlit-based frontend** for user login, claim upload, management, and EDA.
- Creating a modular project structure to support future phases like explainability, RAG, and MLOps.
- Implementing the complete AI prediction loop â€” user inputs a claim, the model evaluates it, and the frontend displays the severity classification.

## ðŸ§© Phase 1 â€“ Core Model Integration

In this phase, we developed a transformer-based classifier (fine-tuned RoBERTa) trained on a custom dataset derived from real insurance claim data. Raw, keyword-style descriptions were enriched using Falcon-7B to simulate natural language narratives. These were combined with structured metadata (e.g., age, salary, accident date) to form rich `InputText` examples for training.

The Streamlit frontend was simultaneously developed to serve as the user-facing layer of the system. Users can log in, upload claims (individually or in batch), view predicted severity classifications, and explore trends across demographic variables using the EDA dashboard. A management interface was also implemented to browse through uploaded claims in a paginated table. The complete flow â€” from claim upload to risk classification â€” is now functional and ready for real-world validation.
